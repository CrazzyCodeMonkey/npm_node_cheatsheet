# npm_node_cheatsheet
Cheatsheet for NPM and Node.js CLI

## Scope
This Cheatsheet is designed to provide a reference for some of the more common NPM and Node.js CLI commands.

The Useful Packages section is base on my personal experience, and does not reflect actual popularity (npmjs, or GitHub ratings).

The package.json attribute descriptions are very brief, and the [full documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) should be references for detailed descriptions.
